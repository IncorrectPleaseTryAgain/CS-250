# CS-250 Sprint Review | Retrospective

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs with the use of face-to-face conversations that are clear and concise. I use "user stories" 
to summarize key ideas, so that the client and I have a clear understanding of what is expected. Creating these
"user stories" help me as a software developer understand what is expected out of the product and its quality; as
well describing the functionality of the product/features. I would implement these ideas into working software with
the help from backboards so that I can visually trac my progress. I would also hold a retrospective for myself and
any other team members so that we can reflect on what we had accomplished, and how we can improve.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing programs in a very "loose" and pen minded way. Depending on the program and the details surrounding it,
such as its features and deadline, I would balance my approach between an agile and waterfall approach. I would take both
approaches into consideration before sticking with a development process and I try and find an optimal balance between the two.
Some agile processes that I hope to incorporate into my future development work are: user stories, sprints and a backlog, daily standups,
and not particularly a process but more a principle; I would preference face-to-face communication.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
In order to be a good team member in software development means to be someone who people can trust and rely on. You have to be 
someone who is selfless and who thinks of others, especially the client, before themselves. This does not mean that you should 
throw away your morals and not take them into consideration, but it means that you should be open minded and excepting of change.
As a software developer you should not only be relied on but you should also be able to rely on others; trusting others is the only
way to expects others trust in you. Being a part of a team means to work together, thus young will need good communicational skill
so that you can convey your ideas with others in a clear and concise manner. You should be hard-working but not to the point where
it is harmful and lasty, to be a good team member in software development you have to be respectful.
