# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs with the use of face-to-face conversations that are clear and concise. I use "user stories" 
to summarize key ideas, so that the client and I have a clear understanding of what is expected. Creating these
"user stories" help me as a software developer understand what is expected out of the product and its quality; as
well describing the functionality of the product/features. I would implement these ideas into working software with
the help from backboards so that I can visually trac my progress. I would also hold a retrospective for myself and
any other team members so that we can reflect on what we had accomplished, and how we can improve.
