# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs with the use of face-to-face conversations that are clear and concise. I use "user stories" 
to summarize key ideas, so that the client and I have a clear understanding of what is expected. Creating these
"user stories" help me as a software developer understand what is expected out of the product and its quality; as
well describing the functionality of the product/features. I would implement these ideas into working software with
the help from backboards so that I can visually trac my progress. I would also hold a retrospective for myself and
any other team members so that we can reflect on what we had accomplished, and how we can improve.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing programs in a very "loose" and pen minded way. Depending on the program and the details surrounding it,
such as its features and deadline, I would balance my approach between an agile and waterfall approach. I would take both
approaches into consideration before sticking with a development process and I try and find an optimal balance between the two.
Some agile processes that I hope to incorporate into my future development work are: user stories, sprints and a backlog, daily standups,
and not particularly a process but more a principle; I would preference face-to-face communication.
